# SAW Next.js Example (Placeholder)

This placeholder directory will later contain a minimal Next.js route handler exposing `/api/saw/feed` using the core library.

Planned files:
- `app/api/saw/feed/route.ts` – feed route
- `lib/blocks.ts` – in-memory blocks
- Integration test for route with signature verification

Phase 0 only reserves structure.
